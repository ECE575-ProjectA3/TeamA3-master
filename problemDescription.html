<h1 align="center">Cellular Coverage</h1>

<p> The aim of this project is to collect and display cellular
coverage data. To this end, have the phone run some sort of
localization method (e.g., GPS) to determine the location of the
phone, and measure the "quality" of the cellular coverage at that
location. Different measures can be used for quality: availability is
the most coarse, but signal strength is better. For data, the
throughput, and/or delay are relevant quantities.

</p><p> A data point consists of a tuple including the location, timestamp
and coverage quality. All data points will be transferred to a
centralized server for storage in a database (either as they are
collected, or, better, as a batch at the end of the day). From there a
visualizer will process the data-points and display the results in an
easy to interpret graphical form (e.g., by using Google Maps or a
similar GIS software).

</p><p> Ideally, the data can be visualized both on the phone as well as
  from a laptop (or desktop).

</p><p> For clarification: the phone application should have two
  independent components (they can be two apps): the data collection
  component (that collects the data and sends it to the server), and
  the visualization component (that displays the results).

</p><p> Multiple users should be supported.

</p><p> For extra credit do multiple types of readings (e.g., WiFi as
  well, or other providers) and display them separately - ideally the
  user will be able to filter the data using a series of filters
  (e.g., by type of data, network, time of collection, region, etc.)


</p><p>To successfully complete this project you need to have:
</p><ul>
<li> Good knowledge of Java;
</li><li> Familiarity with some GIS software to display the data.
</li></ul>
