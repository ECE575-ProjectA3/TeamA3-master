NOTE: These build instructions assume a Linux-based
	development environment is present

(1) Install gradle and openjdk-7-jre
 
(2) Install Android Studio
		(https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

(3) Do one of the following to locate the Android SDK:

	* Import src/mobileDisplay and src/mobileCOllector into
		Android Studio so it will populate local.properties
		with the SDK path automatically
		
	* set the ANDROID_HOME environmental variable yourself by typing
		"export ANDROID_HOME=<sdk location>"
		
		(tip: this may be "${HOME}/Android/Sdk" depending on your setup)
		
(4) From the command line, navigate to the "src" directory and type:
	"make"

TROUBLESHOOTING

 * If you are on a 64-bit system, installation of Android
	Studio may fail. To resolve this, you must install the
	following 32-bit library packages:
		lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32stdc++6

 * NOTE: The preceeding package names are from the debian repository.
	Ubuntu uses these package names, however other distributions 
	such as Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise may use different names for
	these library packages.
