A Makefile is configured to build the data server, so the server jar can
be built by simply typing "make" from the src directory.

NOTE: implement Makefile instructions for Android apps or provide
      build instructions here!
	  
Mobile collector app:
	- From Android studio, File -> Import projects. Specify the mobile collector app path. once project is loaded, go to Build->Make project, this will build and generates the APK file in app\build\outputs\apk directory.
