	<h2> Practical Problems </h2>
	
	<h4> Data Server </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> In order to permit remote applications to connect to
			 the server, Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers
			 must by enabled on the server. The appropriate headers are
			 specified in the file EnableCORS.java <br><br>
			 <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/">
				Guide detailed here</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4> Web Display </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> The web display was initially subject to the CORS problem
			 detailed above. However, enabling CORS headers on the
			 server resolved the issue.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4> Mobile Display </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> The Android visualization app was likewise subject to the
			 aforementioned CORS problem until the server was fixed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4> Mobile Collector </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> In order to prevent a flood of location and signal strength
			 updates, minimum thresholds should be set to limit the
			 frequency of callbacks. However, if the threshold is too
			 large then the update density will be too low. Our design
			 utilizes a minimum distance of 10 meters and broke the
			 signal strength into 4 sections, with an update occuring
			 only between sections. Additionally, we limited the update
			 frequency to 2 minutes, though in practice this ended up
			 being too high. A much lower recommended time such as 10 to
			 30 seconds is recommended.
		</li>
	</ul>
